                              "Ahh" sighs a huge Daemon sitting on a small chair
                                     "Lucifer, what were you thinking?" 
                                           he mummbels to himself-
                                         slowly, he lifts himself up
                                      "And you! What were you thinking? 
                                     Think you'll just walk out of here?"
