When Dr. Eisenhower steps outside, it's quiet.
But only for a moment or two.
Then out of the sky, hissing raises and he feels himself being pulled up.
Again, tension swells and at the point Dr. Eisenhower cannot bear it any longer,
he flips - right into hell.

Weak and shaky, holding onto his luggage Dr. Eisenhower gathers all his strength.
He braises himself and gets up.

"Oh" HELLo! Doctor!" the devil has a big smile on his face. "Look what you brought with you there! Isn't that nice of you? How have you been?"

Dr. Eisenhower clears his throat, but can't say a word.
"And you're sure you did not forget anything?" says the devil in a sweet voice.
"That's all. Let's get it over with." answers Dr. Eisenhower. His voice is strained.
"What are you rushing me for, my dear? See. Eternity lasts forever! No need to worry about time around here."
The devil is obviously in a good mood.
"...I'm not worrying. Fulfill your part of the pact!" 
"Hahaha, I beg your pardon? What is it exactly that you think I owe you?"
"My life!" Dr. Eisenhower yells "You said you would make me live again, if you can have my research!"

The whip reappears in the devil's hand.
He lashes Dr. Eisenhower, so that he is thrown to the ground. The rips in his flesh burn like fire.
He faints.

When Dr. Eisenhower wakes up again he is soaked in sweat.
His body still hurts and he can hardly see.
Dirt sticking to him, his clothes ripped, he struggles to push himself up.
And suddenly, anger takes over.
Dr. Eisenhower gets furious.
He looks over to his side and seas a Daemon not sitting far from him.
Dr. Eisenhower's eyes turn white.
The daemon nods.
