Dr. Eisenhower walks through the huge iron gates. It's windy and cold. 
At first, he is relieved, feels light.

But as he walks, the wind picks up. Its howling through the chaotic patterns
of undefinable substance around him.
What now? Dr. Eisenhower is weak. He has become used to sweating and as his body 
cools down his breathing gets shallow.
He keeps walking, although it's so dark he can hardly see. His thoughts start twisting and when he tries to focus on something, there is nothing.

Powerful fear takes over is whole being. Fear he has never felt before.
Again, he observes his body travelling through infinite darkness for such long time that his feeling for space, time and his consciousness vanish.

Soft and slow, Dr. Eisenhower begins to wake up.
Its warm, but not hot. And its peaceful.

After some amount of time, things starts speeding up.
A sentiment of being rushed takes over.
Before he can fight it, it turns him. He vomits on the ground that suddenly appears beneath him.

He is back at the lab.

Lethargical he wipes his face and hands with his coat.
There's a weird smell in the air - it's not only vomit, it's sweet, much like decay.

A sudden, sucking noise let's Dr. Eisenhower spin around.

It's a lab assistant. 
His hair is greasy,is cheeks are sunken in and his eyes are white.
"Hello Doctor." he says without expression.
