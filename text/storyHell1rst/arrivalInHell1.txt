Its dark and cold and grey as Dr. Eisenhower wakes up. He finds himself laying on the ground. It feels as if electricity is running through him at immense speed. He shrugs und punches the ground to get rid of some tension.
A loud bang startles him and the ground shakes, like after an explosion. No pain.
"What happened to me?" 
In a weird sort of unworldly confidence Dr. Eisenhower get's up, stretches and pees against the wall.
He feels his dairy in his pocket and starts walking.
