Dr. Eisenhower's diary entry: 
I wonder what date it is. How can I get a grasp of what happened to me? I know it happened to Lucy, too.
Or at least, I know she went through hell, keeping up hope and strength! I must find out who she is!
If it wouldn't have been for her clues, I would have never found a way out! She is my angel... at least I hope so. But there is a certain air of truth to her device.
I will now go into this tunnel. The tunnel that will lead me back to life!
And I hope never to return.
