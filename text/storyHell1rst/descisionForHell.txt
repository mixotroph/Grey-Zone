"What?" screams the devil. 
Thunder let's the slimy walls of the room wobble. His eyes turn white and he moves to lash Dr. Eisenhower again-
suddenly tenses up, turns and angrily lashes the wall instead, leaving rips that start bleeding immediately. 
Dr. Eisenhower stares at the puddle of blood swelling on the floor beneath the wall.
The devil seams worried - even nervous for a moment. He get's up, lights a smoke and bends down towards Dr. Eisenhower.
"You clown." he says slowly. "You're trying to be faithful to the human race? 
No point in that! Of all beings between heaven and hell, humans are the weakest."
"I... I don't think so. Things are changing! We are close to stepping into a new age! I know it!" stutters Dr. Eisenhower. His body shivers. 
"Stop it! You are powerless! You're dead!" grunts the devil." ... and sooner or later I'll get what I want! The human race is only close to giving in."
Dr. Eisenhower faints.
