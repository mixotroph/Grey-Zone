Dr. Eisenhower's diary entry: 
I wonder what date it is. I've reached great insight! Through disappointment about my deeds and situation, tearing me up,
 it became inevitable to me to let go of all pity and pride.
Burning rage aroused in my heart - rage of love. Love for life!
And a miracle ocured!
All of a sudden, I knew what they meant, when they said:
"Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed."
Yes! His word came to me through Lucy!
She is was my saviour, led me to find a way out! I have to find out who she is!
This tunnel will lead me to freedom. I wish never to return to this place.
