Dr. Eisenhower's diary entry: 
We write the year 2073; may 21st. Today it will succeed. I will obtain the final prove the devil's existence in our universe. And more shocking, I think the devil is able to participate in the human world. I have to find out whether this is possible or not. Therefore I use my time-space-decoder to break the space-time continuum and open my mind a gate to the devil's world. Finally, there are only view question's left for me: Are we all obsessed by daemons? Do we have our own will? These are my last words. I conduct the experiment now.


"Hello colleagues, 
you all know the reason for our conference. Today is the day of change, the inception of a new age, stigmatized by knowledge, nobody received before. I proudly present my time-space-decoder. In a view minutes I will tell you about a secret of live. A secret, that has been never brought to light before. The secret of the world after death, the truth about good and evil."

Dr. Eisenhower floats to the time-space-decoder, sits down and puts on the helmed. "Please turn it on, Victor. The new age is coming." 
Dr. Eisenhower's assistant releases the lever.
A bright flash, followed by an ear-splitting bang and a wave of pressed air throws down the audience.
Dr Eisenhower lies on the ground with an twisted neck.
