Welcome to Hell!

Dr Eisenhower was nervous, when the decoder started. But suddenly he only felt pain. Pain that was so strong he could have never imagined. After that he felt nothing. He observed his body travelling through infinite darkness for such long time that his feeling for space, time and his consciousness vanished. His mind fell asleep, until a raw voice woke him up. 
"Huh, an earthling that I did not expected. How can that happen? Explain it to me!" 
Dr Eisenhower: "I'm a scientist exploring a way to step into hell. So, are you the devil? Did my work succeed?" 
Devil : "HAHAHA...Are you stupid? Did You throw your life away to go to hell?" 
Dr Eisenhower: "I'm dead?" 
Devil: "Yes, you are and there is no way to get back to life. So you´re my slave now!" 

A whip appears in the devil's hand and flips towards Dr Eisenhower's waist. 
Despite shock and paralysis, Dr. Eisenhower is well.
The devil repeats it a view times but fails. Again and again. And Dr. Eisenhower did not suffer any damage. 

The Devil roars: "What´s wrong with you?"
He sits down slowly on a massive armchair "I'll give you a choice. 
I could... give you your life back, of course.
And I will do so, IF:
You bring me all your research equipment."
"No! What if I don't?"
" HA! Stupid creature! Otherwise you stay alone, without any human soul. 
You stay in hell for all times. 
Is that want you want?" the Devil grunts.
