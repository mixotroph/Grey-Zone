After noting a view thoughts, Dr. Eisenhower walks down the dark corridor to the front desk.
He will never return to the lab.


Dr. Eisenhower's diary entry: 
We write the date 22st of may in 2073. How can I get a grasp of what is happening to me? How will I live after bringing death... I have no emotions now. But pure logic let's me breath deeper and calms my mind. I only have to hand everything over and will be free!... at leat, I will have the kind of freedom back that life offers to a human.
I can't wait
